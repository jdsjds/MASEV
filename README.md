# MASEV
Computer algorithms associated with analysis and processing of data for the MASEV method.

# Project Abstract
Exosomes and extracellular vesicles (EV) are increasingly being explored as circulating biomarkers, but their heterogenous composition will likely mandate the development of single EV technologies. Iteratively multiplexed analyses of single EVs have been challenging to implement beyond a few colors during spectral sensing. Here we developed a multiplexed analysis of the single EV technique (MASEV) to interrogate thousands of individual EVs during iterative cycles of multi-channel fluorescence staining for EV biomarkers.

# Code Explanation

Computational methods for 1. aligning images 2. segmenting EV 3. Extracting intensity. Included here are python script and sample data for illustrating how computational analysis was completed for these goals.
